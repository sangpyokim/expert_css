                    “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are
                    some of the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple
                    black cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced.
                    Many come from films that aren't necessarily “horror” but
                    have elements or threads of horror, and all have the same
                    general effect: unease, dread, fear, shock, disgust.
